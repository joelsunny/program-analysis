 Write a tool in your chosen language which will take this AST as input and print
    1) all the assignment statements
    2) all branch conditions and loop conditions in the original python program.

A set of test cases (at least 5) with expected output.

A Readme file (txt/pdf/doc/docx) which will give a short report (half to one page maximum) on how you accomplished this task and how to build and run your source on any input python file.

A shell script named "run" which will take a python file as input, invoke ast2json to dump the corresponding AST and finally invoke your tool to print the required output (assignments, branch and loop conditions).
